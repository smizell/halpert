# Halpert

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smizell/halpert.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/smizell/halpert)

Halpert is a library with the goal of teaching clients and servers about hypermedia formats they may not understand. Representations of a resource can be given to Halpert along with a desired media type, and Halpert will convert to this media type.

Halpert converts to and builds from the [Hyperdescribe](https://github.com/smizell/hyperdescribe) format, which is a format for describing a hypermedia resource.
